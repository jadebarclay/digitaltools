[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a free, open-source tool for cleaning messy data. Do you have a survey data set with responses like 'no', nah', 'not really', and 'n/a' that all mean the same thing? Or rows of data that need to be split or combined? OpenRefine is very good at tidying this sort of thing.

Want to try it out?
