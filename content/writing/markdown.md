## Markdown

`Markdown` is a simple and popular text formatting syntax. It has many advantages for academic writing: it is stable, reliable, easy to read and produces plain text files which are easily shared. It's worth becoming familiar with it.

## LaTeX

`LaTeX` is a text formatting language (like `Markdown`) which is very flexible and robust. It is well suited to scientific and mathematical notation. In LaTeX, document content and structure is separated from formatting and style, so you can work on one without worrying about the other. Here is a [good explanation](https://nitens.org/w/latex/) of why LaTeX is a useful tool for academic and scientific writing.

`BibTeX` is a counterpart program to LaTeX that generates bibilographies for academic and research papers. It can also integrate with the open-source reference manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

## Pandoc

`Pandoc` is an open-source tool that can convert just about any document format into just about any other document format! You can use it to convert your `Markdown` or `LaTeX` documents into Word â€” even automatically if you want!

You can read an excellent tutorial on academic writing using Markdown and Pandoc [here](https://github.com/GriffithUniLibrary/digital-tools).
