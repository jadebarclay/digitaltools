This site is designed as a companion to [Jade Barclay's](https://jadebarclay.github.io) Digital Tools for Research Life workshop, presented in collaboration with [PhD Cafe](mailto:jade.barclay@sydney.edu.au?subject=PhDCafe). The recommended apps, tools and techniques are updated after each live workshop. It can also be treated as a standalone, self-paced tutorial.
